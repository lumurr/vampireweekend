  <h1 class="title">LYRICS TO "DIPLOMAT'S SON" BY VAMPIRE WEEKEND</h1>
<div class="text">[Verse 1: Ezra Koenig]</div>
<div class="text">It's not right, but it's now or never</div>
<div class="text">And if I wait, could I ever forgive myself?</div>
<div class="text">On a night when the moon glows yellow in the riptide</div>
<div class="text">With the light from the TVs buzzing in the house</div><br>

<div class="text">[Pre-Chorus: Ezra Koenig]</div>
<div class="text">'Cause I'm gonna cut it where I can</div>
<div class="text">And then I'm gonna duck out behind them</div>
<div class="text">If I ever had a chance, it's now then</div>
<div class="text">But I never had the feeling I could offer that to you</div>
<div class="text">To offer it to you would be cruel</div>
<div class="text">When all I want to do is use, use you</div><br>

<div class="text">[Chorus: Ezra Koenig]</div>
<div class="text">He was a diplomat's son, it was '81</div>
<div class="text">He was a diplomat's son, it was '81</div>
<div class="text">Oh-oh, oh-oh</div><br>

<div class="text">[Verse 2: Ezra Koenig]</div>
<div class="text">Dressed in white with my car keys hidden in the kitchen</div>
<div class="text">I could sleep wherever I lay my head</div>
<div class="text">And the sight of your two shoes sitting in the bathtub</div>
<div class="text">Let me know that I shouldn't give up just yet</div><br>

<div class="text">[Pre-Chorus: Ezra Koenig]</div>
<div class="text">'Cause I'm gonna take it from Simon</div>
<div class="text">And then I'm gonna duck out behind them</div>
<div class="text">If I ever had a chance, it's now then</div>
<div class="text">But I never had the feeling I could offer that to you</div>
<div class="text">To offer it to you would be cruel</div>
<div class="text">When all I want to do is use, use you</div><br>
<div class="text">[Chorus: Ezra Koenig]</div>
<div class="text">He was a diplomat's son, it was '81</div>
<div class="text">He was a diplomat's son, it was '81</div>
<div class="text">Oh-oh, oh-oh</div><br>

<div class="text">[Bridge: Rostam Batmanglij]</div>
<div class="text">I know, you'll say I'm not doing it right</div>
<div class="text">But this is how I want it</div>
<div class="text">I can't go back to how I felt before</div>
<div class="text">There'sâ€“</div><br>

<div class="text">[Verse 3: Ezra Koenig]</div>
<div class="text">That night I smoked a joint with my best friend</div>
<div class="text">We found ourselves in bed, when I woke up, he was gone</div><br>

<div class="text">[Chorus: Ezra Koenig]</div>
<div class="text">He was a diplomat's son, it was '81</div>
<div class="text">He was a diplomat's son, it was '81</div><br>

<div class="text">[Instrumental Break]</div><br>

<div class="text">[Outro: Ezra Koenig]</div>
<div class="text">Looking out at the ice cold water all around me</div>
<div class="text">I can't feel any traces of that other place</div>
<div class="text">In the dark, when the wind comes racing off the river</div>
<div class="text">There's a car, all black with diplomatic plates</div><br>
